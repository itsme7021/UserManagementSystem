# UserManagementSystem
A management system in which an user can register himself, fetch user information, delete it and update it also.

I have created a rest api using spring boot, I have used a list to store the users details.
An user details include {UserId , Name, Company, Role}
To avoid redundancy I have assumed that every user has an unique UserId
I used postman to test the api
